This repo is a personal collection of 50 Express.js practice questions I’ve been working through to sharpen my backend skills.

Right now, I’ve completed 30 questions, and I’m steadily working my way to 50. Each question is solved in a separate file and focuses on a specific Express.js concept — from building basic servers and handling routes, to working with middleware, query params, headers, file uploads, and more.

This repo is a reflection of my learning journey, and I hope it can be helpful to anyone else learning Express.js. Whether you’re just starting out or brushing up before interviews, feel free to explore the code, try out the examples, or even suggest improvements.
